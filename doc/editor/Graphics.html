<h1>Section 12: Customizing Graphics</h1>

<p>One of the best ways to put your own personal spin on your scenario is to give it your
own graphics. You can provide your own graphics for monsters, items, terrain (animated or
not), and dialog pictures (36 x 36).</p>

<p>To create your own graphics, you need to use a painting program. The basic dimension of
customized graphics is 28 x 36. The custom graphics must be arranged in a one single PICT
(Macintosh) or .BMP file (Windows) which is 280 wide (wide enough for 10 graphics and some
multiple of 36 (36,72, 108, etc.) high. This single graphic containing all your custom
graphics is called the custom sheet.</p>

<p>The custom graphics are arranged on the custom sheet in rows, 10 to each row. Each row
is considered to have 10 slots. The first ten slots are in the top row, the next 10 slots
are in the next row, and so on. The upper left graphic is considered slot 0. The top row
contains slots 0 to 9 (numbered left to right), the second row contains slots 11 to 20,
and so on.</p>

<h2>How to Make Your Custom Sheet (Macintosh)</h2>

<p>Make your graphic in a painting program. Make it in the standard Macintosh 256 color
palette. Find a copy of the freeware Apple utility ResEdit (available online, or at the
Spiderweb Software web site, www.spidweb.com). Run it and make a new resource file. Give
the file the same name as your scenario file, but with .meg at the end instead of .exs
(for example, if your scenario is called swords.exs, title the graphics resource file
swords.meg).</p>

<p>Select the custom sheet in your painting program, and copy it. Move to ResEdit, and
select paste to paste your graphic into the resource file as a PICT. Double click on the
PICT icon in the ResEdit window, and you will see your custom graphic. Click on it, hit
Command-I, and give the PICT resource number 1. Save the file, and copy it into the Blades
of Exile Scenario folder.</p>

<h2>How to Make Your Custom Sheet (Windows)</h2>

<p>You must make your graphic in a painting program. However, you need to use a palette
similar to the Blades of Exile palette. Create a copy of one of the Blades of Exile
graphics files. Give the file the same name as your scenario file, but with .bmp at the
end instead of .exs (for example, if your scenario is called swords.exs, title the bitmap
file swords.bmp).</p>

<p>Open it with your painting program, and change its size to the size of your custom
sheet. Draw your graphic here, so that you can be sure to be using the same palette as
Blades of Exile. Place your bitmap file in the BLDSSCEN folder to use it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that Macintosh and Windows custom graphics are not compatible. If you don't know
how to translate a custom graphics file, submit your full scenario at www.spidweb.com (or
mail a copy on disk to us) and we'll translate your graphics file when we put your
adventure on our web site (more on this in the next chapter).</p>

<p>Custom graphics can be drawn in the scenario editor. To see your custom graphics, place
your custom graphics file in the same folder/directory as your scenario. If your graphics
file isn't there, the custom graphics won't be known. This is a good way to test to make
sure your custom graphics file is valid.</p>

<h2>Placing and Using Your Custom Graphics</h2>

<p>When you use custom graphics, you must arrange them properly on your custom sheet, and
then tell the editor to use them. These are the graphics you can customize, and how to use
them:</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Terrain (not animated) - </b>Place the 28 x 36 custom terrain graphic in one of the
custom sheets slots. To give a terrain type this graphic, add 1000 to the number of the
slot the graphic is in, and put that number in the Terrain Picture field on the editing
terrain window.</p>
<p>To use this graphic as the dialog picture in a dialog (created by a special node),
select Display Dialog (Terrain pic) as the special node type. Add 1000 to the slot the
graphic is in, and put that number in the Pict spot.</p>

<p><b>Terrain (animated) -</b> Animated terrain has four different graphics. Put the 4
graphics in 4 consecutive custom sheet slots. To give a terrain type this graphic, add
2000 to the number of the slot the first of the four graphics is in, and put that number
in the Terrain Picture field on the editing terrain window.</p>

<p><b>Monster (1 x 1) - </b>There are 4 graphics needed: monster facing right, monster
facing left, monster attacking facing right, and monster attacking facing left. Put these
4 graphics in 4 consecutive custom sheet slots. To give a monster type this graphic, add
1000 to the number of the slot the first of the four graphics is in, and put that number
in the Monster Picture field on the editing monster window.</p>
<p>To use this graphic as the dialog picture in a dialog (created by a special node),
select Display Dialog (Monster pic) as the special node type. Add 1000 to the slot the
first of the 4 graphics is in, and put that number in the Pict spot.</p>

<p><b>Monster (2 x 1) -</b> There are 8 graphics needed: the left half and then the right
half of the monster facing right, the left half and then the right half of the monster
facing left, the 2 parts of the monster attacking facing right, and the 2 parts of the
monster attacking facing left. Put these 8 graphics in 8 consecutive custom sheet slots.
To give a monster type this graphic (and make it a 2 x 1 monster), add 2000 to the number
of the slot the first of the four graphics is in, and put that number in the Monster
Picture field on the editing monster window.</p>

<p><b>Monster (1 x 2), Monster (2 x 2) -</b> These 2 graphics require 8 and 16 custom
sheet slots. Put the parts of the monster facing right, then facing left, then attacking
right, then attacking left, with the parts arranged left to right and top to bottom. To
give a monster type this graphic, add 3000 (if 1 x 2) or 4000 (if 2 x 2) to the number of
the slot the first of the four graphics is in, and put that number in the Monster Picture
field on the editing monster window.</p>

<p><b>Dialog Picture -</b> You can put a custom 36 x 36 graphic in the upper left corner
of a dialog box. Split the graphic into 2 18 x 36 halves, and put the 2 graphics in 2
consecutive custom sheet slots (pushed into the upper left corner).</p>
<p>To use this graphic as the dialog picture in a dialog (created by a special node),
select Display Dialog (Dialog pic) as the special node type. Add 1000 to the slot the left
half is in, and put that number in the Pict spot.</p>

<p><b>Item - </b>An item graphic takes up one 28 x 36 slot. Add 150 to the slot the
graphic is in, and put that number in the Item Picture field on the editing items window.
You can only put new item graphics in the first 105 slots (the highest item graphic number
Blades can handle is 255).</p>
<p><b>Face in Dialogue - </b>You can customize the face of a character the party is
talking to. A dialogue face is a 32x32 graphic. Split the graphic into 2 16x32 halves, and
put them in two adjacent slots (left half in one slot, and then the right half in the next
slot). Add 1000 to the slot the left half is in, and put that number in the Facial Graphic
space in the Editing a Townsperson/Monster window.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For examples of using custom graphics, look at the scenarios that came with Blades of
Exile. The three Blades of Exile scenarios, between them, contain examples of Custom
Sheets with all of the different sorts of custom graphics.</p>
