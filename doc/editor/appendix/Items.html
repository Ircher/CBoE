<h1>Appendix 2 - Item Ability Types</h1>

<p>Each item type can have a special ability. The types of abilities available range from
shooting fireballs to weapons doing special damage to dragons to items being ingredients
for alchemical recipes.</p>
<p>There are two types of item abilities: usable and inherent.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Usable abilities:</b> Usable item abilities are only activated by pressing the
items use button on the PC inventory screen. Otherwise, the ability has no effect.
Examples are a wand that shoots fireballs or a healing potion.
<p>Usable abilities are always linked to the items charges. Whenever an item with a usable
ability is actually used, the items amount of charges goes down by 1. When the items
charge level goes down to 0, the item disappears. An item with a usable ability must have
at least 1 charge.</p>
<p>The cash value of an item with a usable ability is calculated differently from normal
items. The items actual cost is its value multiplied by the number of its charges.
(Example: Suppose a Potion of Healing has a value of 100 and 2 charges. This potion would
cost 200 gold and sell for half that.)</li>
<li><b>Inherent Abilities:</b>Inherent abilities are abilities that are always present and
are activated automatically, as opposed to being activated by pressing the Use button on
the PC Inventory screen. Examples are a shield with fire protection (which is activated
automatically when the character takes fire damage) or comfrey root (whose ability it that
it can be used as an alchemical ingredient, and which is used automatically when the party
tries to make a potion with it).
<p>Some inherent abilities have charges (such as alchemical ingredients). When used, the
amount of charges goes down by one. When there are no charges left, the item disappears.
The name of inherent ability types that require charges have a (c) after them.The value of
these items is calculated the same way as for Usable abilities.</p>
<p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are six different classes of item ability type, each with its own properties and
varieties of items that can possess it. These are listed below, along with whether they
are classes of Usable or Inherent abilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Weapon Abilities (Inherent):</b> Abilities of this type can be given to one and two
handed weapons, weapon ammunition (darts, arrows, etc.) and non-ammunition missiles (like
slings). None of these items have charges.</li>
<li><b>General Abilities (Inherent):</b>Abilities of this type can be given to non-missile
items which can be equipped (e.g. rings, armor, sword, but not arrows) but not to items
that cant (e.g. wands, potions). Only a few of these ability types require for the item
having them to have charges.</li>
<li><b>Non-Spell Usable (Usable):</b> Abilities of this type change the status of the
party or individual character in some way, such as making them more or less poisoned, or
raising or lowering health. Abilities of these types can be given to any item thats not a
missile (e.g. arrows, bolts). Being usable item abilities, any item having one of these
abilities must have charges.</li>
<li><b>Spell Usable (Usable):</b> Abilities of this type cast some sort of a spell, such
as firing a fireball or summoning monsters. Abilities of these types can be given to any
item thats not a missile (e.g. arrows, bolts). Being usable item abilities, any item
having one of these abilities must have charges.</li>
<li><b>Reagents (Inherent):</b> Items with these abilities are alchemical ingredients,
spell reagents (e.g. smoky crystals, sapphires), or similar substances. All items with an
ability of this type must have charges, and must be of variety Non-use Object.</li>
<li><b>Missiles (Inherent):</b> These abilities can only be given to missiles (e.g.
arrows, bolts, darts). Each ability is activated when the missile is fired (such as
exploding a fireball on the target space).</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned before, each item type has accompanying Ability Strength and Magic Item
Adjust targets. For each ability, these two fields have different ranges and different
affects, and their values will modify the affects of the item abilities in different ways.
What each ability does and how the Ability Strength and Magic Item Adjust fields affect it
are described below.</p>

<h2>Non-Spell Usable (Usable)</h2>

<p>Each of these item abilities affects a character's statistics (e.g. health, spell
points) or status (e.g. poison, flying) when the item is used.</p>
<p>For each of these abilities, the Ability Strength is a number from 0 to 10, which
represents the strength of the ability (0 is weakest, 10 is most powerful). The meaning of
this changes depending on the ability affected. Sometimes, the number affects the
duration, sometimes the damage done.</p>
<p>The Item Use Properties buttons affect whether using the item affects just the using
character or the whole party, and whether the item helps or hurts the party.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of these abilities can only help (like Bliss) or only hurt (like Doom). For these
abilities, the Magic Item Adjust values of 0 and 1 have the same effect, and the values 2
and 3 have the same effect. Also, some abilities only affect the whole party (like Light
or Firewalk).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Example: Suppose you give an item the ability Dumbfound, set Ability Strength to 2, and
Magic Item Adjust to 0. Then, when the item is used, the user's level of dumbfounding will
go down a little bit. If Ability Strength is set instead to 10, the user will be totally
cured of Dumbfounding.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose you give an item the ability Cause/Cure Acid, set Ability Strength to
5, and Magic Item Adjust to 3. When someone uses the item, the entire party gets 5 levels
of acid (which means the acid lasts about 5 turns).</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ability 70 - Poison Weapon</dt>
<dd>Increases or decreases the amount of poison on the user's/party's weapons. If the item
is beneficial, when used, the user has a chance (based on the Poison skill) of poisoning
him/herself.</dd>

Health will not be reduced below 0. This can be as high as 20.</dd>

amount.</dd>
