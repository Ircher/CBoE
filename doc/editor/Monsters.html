<h1>Section 7 - Editing Monster Types</h1>

<p>Your default scenario comes with 187 premade monster types, number 1 to 187, and you
can have 256 monster types overall. Like terrain types, you can customize the monster
types to suit your scenario. Click on Edit Monster Types to bring up a list of creatures,
and click on a monster type to bring up the monster editing window. This window has these
options:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Monster Name:</b> The name of the creature.</li>
<li><b>Level:</b> Determines how much morale and skill the creature has. You should make
this at least 1.</li>
<li><b>Health:</b> Number of health points.</li>
<li><b>Armor:</b> The damage from each weapon blow is reduced by a random amount from 1 to
this number.</li>
<li><b>Skill:</b> Determines chance of hitting and gives an extra damage bonus.</li>
<li><b>Speed:</b> Number of action points monster gets each turn.</li>
<li><b>Mage Spells, Priest Spells:</b> Strength of spells creature casts. This is from 0 -
7, 0 meaning no spells and 7 meaning the strongest spells.</li>
<li><b>Attack Damage Number of Dice and Sides:</b> The amount of damage the monster does
when it hits. For example, if a blow does eight dice of damage, each of which has 11
sides, the program generates 8 random numbers from 1 to 11, adds them up, and does that
much damage. A monster can have up to 3 different attacks.</li>
<li><b>Monster Type:</b> Press Choose to pick a monster type (e.g. human, insect, demon,
etc.).</li>
<li><b>Attack 1 Type, Attack 2-3 Type:</b> Press Choose to select an attack type (e.g. bite,
claw, etc.)</li>
<li><b>Treasure:</b> Determines how much treasure the monster leaves when killed (0 - none,
to 4 - lots). Don't have common creatures leave treasure of type 3 or 4.</li>
<li><b>Default Talking Picture:</b> Press Choose to select the default picture the player
sees when talking to this character. This can be changed for individual creatures when
editing towns.</li>
<li><b>Default Attitude:</b> Select the attitude the monster has when first placed (which
can be changed when the monster is placed, using the Edit Monster button).</li>
</ul>

<p>The monster type can also have a wide variety of special abilities. To edit them, press
the Abilities button.</p>

<h2>Editing Monster Abilities</h2>

<p>The monster abilities screen has a wide variety of options.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Monster Poison -</b> A number from 0 to 8 (0 - none, 8 - powerful).</li>
<li><b>Breath Weapon, Breath Weapon Type -</b> The weapon is a number from 0 to 40 (0 -
none, 40 - strong). This is the number of random numbers from 1 to 8 to sum to generate
the breath damage. The type is the damage type of the breath (e.g. fire, cold, etc.).</li>
<li><b>Special Ability - </b> Press choose to pick the monster's special ability. These are
listed in the Monster Abilities section, later in this chapter.</li>
<li><b>Summon Type -</b> Determines whether the monster can be summoned by the mages
summoning spells. Type 1 monsters are easy to summon, while Type 3 monsters require much
more powerful spells. If No Summon is selected, spells never summon the monster.</li>
<li><b>Create Monsters/Fields -</b> Press choose to pick the monster's ability to summon aid
or radiate magical fields. Several of these require giving an extra value in the text area
just below. The abilities and values needed are listed in the Monster Abilities section,
later in this chapter.</li>
<li><b>Item To Drop When Killed, Chance of Dropping -</b> The number of an item to place
when the monster is killed (like a spider fang when a spider is killed in Exile), and the
chance to place it (0 - 100).</li>
<li><b>Monster Resistances -</b> You can have the monster take half or no damage from fire,
cold, magic, and poison.</li>
</ul>

hostile, it becomes stronger and will immediately seek out the party to kill them (even if
it started out immobile).</li>
</ul>

<p>Each monster can also radiate dangerous fields, or summon monsters to its aid. Press
the Choose button to select one of these abilities. You will then need to input an extra
value into the text area just below:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Radiate Fire Fields (or ice, shock, antimagic, sleep, or stink fields): </b>The
monster occasionally surrounds itself with a field of the selected sort. The extra value
is the chance of the creature doing so on any given turn.</li>
<li>If a creature radiates fire fields, you probably shouldn't put it near creatures who
aren't immune to fire.</li>
<li><b>Summon (%5, %20, %50 chance):</b> The extra value is the number of the creature this
creature occasionally summons. The chance is the chance each turn of the creature
appearing.</li>
<li><b>Death Triggers Scenario Special (Advanced):</b> The extra value is the number of a
scenario special node, which is called when a creature of this type is killed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some Monsters Should be Left Alone</h2>

<p>Certain monster types are summoned by mage spells, and should be left alone. These
monster types are Guardian, Demon, Snake, Asp, Shade, and Deva.</p>
