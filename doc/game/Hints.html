<h1>Hints For Getting Started</h1>
<p>Blades of Exile is not an easy game. The monsters are many, and very unforgiving of
error. Gold can often be scarce, and the puzzles are tricky. Fortunately, when the going
gets tough, there are plenty of resources available to you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change the game. Select the Preferences option from the File menu, and select Easier
Monsters. Your fights from then on will be a lot less stressful. You can also reduce the
number of wandering monsters, but this may not be a good idea, as ...</li>
  <li>Wandering monsters are your friends. In Valley of Dying Things, wander around the
surface in the northeast corner of valley, killing goblins and bandits. They have good
gold, and aren't too tough to fight. Rely heavily on magic at first, until your fighters
gain experience.</li>
  <li>There's a lot of encounters and treasures hidden in the outdoors. Remember - to
search for secret passages, walk into walls. Walking into mountains around the start will
reveal several bits of loot.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to take all the stuff in Fort Talrus (in Valley of Dying Things).
There's stuff for you in all of the storerooms. Use the Unlock spell to get into the
locked rooms.</li>
  <li>If you get stuck on a puzzle, look in the next chapter. There's a walkthrough for
Valley of Dying Things..</li>
</ul>
