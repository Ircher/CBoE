<h1>About Blades of Exile</h1>
<h2>About this copy</h2>
<p>This is Blades of Exile, a huge, highly-detailed Shareware fantasy role-playing system
for the Macintosh. This remarkable set of programs contains nearly infinite possibilities
for adventure. First, the game itself comes with three full, exciting scenarios, filled
with excitement, puzzles, and role-playing. Then there is the Blades of Exile scenario
editor, which you can use to make your own role-playing adventures to play yourself or
trade with friends. Finally, you can obtain scenarios which other people have made with
the scenario editor and play through them yourself. Even when you've finished the
scenarios that come with Blades, you've only started to tap the potential for fun this
product offers you!</p>
<p>In 2007, ten years after the original release of BoE, the source code of the game was
released, and the tedious process of updating the game to modern standards began.</p>
