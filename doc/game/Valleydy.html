<h1>How to Solve Valley of Dying Things</h1>
<p>This chapter contains all the information you need to get to the end of the scenario
Valley of Dying Things.It does not contain the solution to every puzzle. For the minor
puzzles and quests, you’ll just have to work them out on your own. What this guide does
provide are directions for navigating your way through the main storyline, from the first
steps all the way to the grand conclusion.</p>
<p>When you get stuck, go to the section on the appropriate scenario. Each section is
divided into subsections, each of which describes a specific part of the scenario. The
subsections begin with several questions you might be asking about how to get through.
Read these sample questions first. If none of them make any sense, back up to an earlier
subsection.</p>
<p>When you find the subsection that describes the area you’re stuck in, start reading.
Slowly. Eventually, you get to the area you’re having problems with. If the place you’re
stuck at isn’t described, the puzzle you’re working on isn’t important to the overall
adventure and can be skipped.</p>
<p>When you’ve found out what you need to know, go back to playing. Try not to read too
far ahead ... too many hints can spoil your adventure!</p>

<p>What do the coordinates mean? All of the walkthroughs have coordinates. For example,
one hint might be “Now step on the rune at (18,5).” In Blades of Exile, the upper left
corner is considered to be (0,0). The spot 5 to the right of that is (5,0). The spot 8
below (0,0) is (0,8). To find out where you currently are, cast the first level priest
spell Location. This should help you find your way to the correct space.</p>

<h2>Getting Into the School</h2>

<p>Sample Questions: How do I start investigating the problem? Where should I look? What’s
this school people are talking about? Where do I find Avizo? How do I get into the
school?</p>

<p>You begin the scenario in Fort Talrus. Leave to the north, and travel up to Sweetgrove.
Once inside, talk to Mayor Crouch to find out about the valley’s troubles, and then talk
to Axel to find out about the old library (talk to other people for useful background). He
mentions you should talk to someone named Avizo. Travel back south to Fort Talrus. Avizo
is in the room next to where you started. Ask him about ‘stone’ to get him to talk to you,
and then ask about “object” to find out where the Runed Stone is. Go back north to
Sweetgrove. Avizo’s store is on the center of town. Break in (use the mage spell Unlock)
and search the potted plant at (35,21). Take the stone.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to start investigating the School of Magery. It’s north of Sweetgrove.
There’s a large mountain up there with four entrances, north, south, east, and west (to
get to the west entrance, walk over the river by the Ford Here sign). Enter at each point,
and insert the stone in the hole by the gate. The gates will open, and the school will be
open to you.</p>

<h2>The School of Magery - Upper Half</h2>

<p>Sample Questions: What do I do in the upper levels of the school? What do I do in the
Holding Cells/Storage areas? How do I help the dragon? How do I pass the blocked wall at
the south end of the Administration level? How do I pass the glowing gates?</p>

<p>The stairway down from the School Entry level is in the center. Go down to the
Visitor’s Quarters. There are two stairways down on that level, one to the Holding Cells
and one to the Storage Areas. One stairway is in the east half of the level. To get there,
there is a secret door at (31,2). Go down to the Storage Level first.</p>
<p>There are several places on these levels with closed, glowing gates. Ignore them for
now. You’ll get the item to open these much later.</p>
<p>Once on the Storage level, walk south down the central corridor until you reach the
sign that reads “HIGH SECURITY CREATURE HOLDING CELL”. Enter this area, and find the
dragon Pythras. Talk to her about her imprisonment, and be sure to ask about “magic” or
“word.” Go back up to the Visitor’s Quarters and down to the Holding Cells.</p>
<p>The controls to Pythras’ cell are at the east side of the Holding Cells level. Go
through the secret door at (46,26), and go to (39,18) to use the control panel. Say
“quark” to it, and Pythras will be freed. If you want to explore the northwest corner, you
can use the control panel at (41,23).</p>
<p>Pythras escapes the school by going down to the Administrative level. Follow her. Climb
down the stairway at (14,42) (in the Holding Cell level - there’s also a stairway down in
the Storage Level).</p>
<p>Administration has been wrecked, but you can still make your way through it. There’s a
colony of Giant, Intelligent, Friendly Talking Spiders in the southeast corner, but you
don’t need to talk to them yet. Instead, you can leave the upper half of the school at the
southwest corner of the level.</p>

<h2>The School of Magery - Lower Half</h2>

<p>Sample Questions: What can I do about the pollution in the cave below the upper half of
the school? What do I do at the Major Waste Depository? How do I get into the lower half
of the school? How do I reach the stairway down from the Student Quarters? How do I get
into the school library? What can I learn from the Vahnatai? How do I exit the Experiment
Halls to the south? The people of Marralis want a scepter - where is it?</p>

<p>When you leave the Administration level, you will find yourself in a huge cavern filled
with diseased pollution and filth. This is the source of the Valley’s problem. This huge
cavern has several interesting things in it. There is a tunnel up to the surface to the
west, which will provide a useful shortcut. To the southeast is the Major Waste
Repository. You can explore it a little if you want, but you can’t do anything there
yet.</p>
<p>Instead, enter the lower half of the school. The entrance is at the southwest corner of
the large cave. You will meet many hostile gremlins. Kill them. These were the student
quarters. You will need to find a key to get through. Walk into the west half of the
level, go south to (1,46), and search the bookshelf there to get the key.<</p>
<p>There is a scepter hidden at (12,6), which some people on the surface want. It can also
cure your disease. You might want to keep it - this is very useful later on.</p>
<p>When you have the key, find your way to the door at (32,37), and go through. You will
be in the main dining hall. Go down the stairway on the right, and you will be in the
School Library. The library is closed off by another glowing portcullis. You can’t enter
it yet. Instead, leave the library at (43,35). You will be in a cavern with several
Vahnatai. Talk to them. In particular, talk to Baia-Tel and ask about the “peculiar
insect” it said it met. Ask Zereen about “power” or “stone.” Finally, they will tell you
that someone on the surface has the instructions to the School controls. This will be
important later.</p>
<p>Now that you know that the spiders have something you need, go back up to the
Administration level. Talk to different spiders until you meet their chief, and ask it
about the “pretty rock.” It will tell you about the giant gnats, and, if you ask, tell you
that the password to get to the gnats is “Gnats.” Tell this to the spider at (57,35) and
you will be able to reach the gnats.</p>
<p>The eggs you need are at (59,4). Get them and go back to the chief spider. Ask it about
“eggs” and it will tell you where the Opening Stone is. Search the trash at (25,3) to get
it. You can use this item from the Special Items page. When you do, all glowing
portcullises on your current level will open. This will be very useful. Go back down to
the Library level.</p>
<p>Open the glowing gate and search the library. The most interesting room is the one in
the northeast corner. The room only contains a pedestal, and, when you enter, a ghost
tells you that you should place a green book on it.</p>
<p>The green book the spirit refers to is a school textbook. There are three of them in
this dungeon. To find one, from the Library level, climb down the stairway at (45,47). You
will be on the Experiment Halls level. Go through the door at (36,9) and then the door at
(40,11). There will be a green book in this cell. Take it back to the library and place it
onto the pedestal in the northeast corner. You will be rewarded with a key. You now are
ready to start ending the Valley’s Curse. First, you need to return to the surface. There
is a shortcut up in the Experiment Halls level at (44,13).</p>

<h2>Ending the Curse</h2>

<p>Sample Questions: What do I do at Pangle’s Hut? How do I talk to Pangle? How do I get
to (and through) the School’s control chambers? What do I do at the Major Waste
Depository?</p>

<p>Once on the surface, you need to get the instructions scroll from Pangle. However, he
won’t want to talk to you. Fortunately, Kevin, in Marralis, is a friend of his. Kevin
tells you to say his name to Pangle. Go to Pangle, say “Kevin” to him, and question him
for a while. Ask about “adventurers” or “interest”, and you will be told about his scroll.
Ask about “paper,” and then search the chest at (10,24) to get the instructions to operate
the school control. You’re now ready to solve the valley’s problem. Go back down to the
Experiment Halls level.</p>
<p>Leave the level to the south (you’ll use the silver key), and you will be in the caves
under the school. Fight your way through them to the southeast corner, where you find a
cave. Enter it.</p>
<p>You will be inside the Control Rooms. Use the Opening Stone to get inside. Find your
way through to the control chambers on the east side. You will find a shade to talk to,
who will tell you a lot of things about the situation with the school. Sit in the throne
at (34,20), and the controls to clean up the waste will be activated.</p>
<p>Finally, travel back up to the giant cavern between the Upper and Lower halves of the
school and enter the Major Waste Depository. Go through the secret passage at (38,39).
Walk up to the gate at (29,2), through the gap at (14,15), and through the gate at (18,24)
into the center of the repository. Use the Opening Stone to open the glowing gate, and sit
in the chair at (23,23). Sit in the chair, flip the switch, and insert the stone. The
cleaning process will begin. Walk out to (26,23), and you will be carried out to safety.
You’ve won.</p>
